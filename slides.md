# What Godot is

- A fully featured, free, open‚Äësource 2D/3D game engine with an all‚Äëin‚Äëone lightweight editor.
- Broad platform support for development and deployment: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web, XR (Quest/Horizon
  OS), and consoles (Switch, Xbox, PS5).
- Architecture: user‚Äëfacing ‚Äúscenes and nodes‚Äù on top of high‚Äëperformance ‚Äúservers‚Äù (data‚Äëoriented systems for
  rendering, physics, etc.).
- Scripting: GDScript (tight integration), C# (high performance but historically less tightly integrated), and
  GDExtension bindings for many languages (C++, Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript).
- Notable tech: Jolt Physics integrated in 4.4; flexible modern rendering (forward+ hybrid, real‚Äëtime GI, scalable
  low‚Äëend renderer); strong i18n including full RTL support.

# Free & Open Source

- Transparency: inspect [source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), understand internals, learn from it
- Control: fix bugs, fork, or extend without waiting
- Community: [proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/), [contributions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/index.html), add‚Äëons, and peer support
- Longevity: projects aren‚Äôt tied to a vendor‚Äôs business model
- Licensing clarity: permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license), no royalties
- [Godot foundation](https://godot.foundation/)

# Modular & Well Architected

- [Strong guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/best_practices_for_engine_contributors.html) allowing thousands of contributors
- [Addons](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset) extend the engine with new features (gdscript, C#)
- Engine is [modular](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/optimizing_for_size.html#disabling-unwanted-modules) (can be compiled without 3D for example)
- [GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html) allows writing C/C++ modules without engine forks
    - Terrain support
    - Language
      bindings ([D](https://github.com/godot-dlang/godot-dlang), [Go](https://github.com/grow-graphics/gd), [Nim](https://github.com/godot-nim/gdext-nim), [Rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext), [Swift](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot), [Odin](https://github.com/dresswithpockets/odin-godot),
      etc.)
- Godot is written "in godot"

# The Scene Tree

<div class="float-right">
  <img src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/nodes_and_scene_instances_player_scene_example.webp" class="h-72 rounded shadow" />
</div>

- Games are built from scenes composed of nodes arranged in a tree.
- Each node provides a focused responsibility (e.g., Sprite2D, Area3D, AnimationPlayer).
- Focus on composition: reuse via instancing scenes as children of others.
- Signals decouple communication between nodes (event-driven).

# Adoption and momentum

- Unity's [controversial pricing changes](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-announce-new-pricing-and-plan-changes/) in 2023 (since then canceled)
- Now appearing in industry surveys; projected significant growth this decade.
- Revenue traction: >$1M Godot games growing; cumulative revenues nearing $100M with strong YoY growth.
- Signals of industry trust: established studios [migrating projects](https://gamefromscratch.com/developer-experiences-moving-to-godot-from-unity/) and catalogs to Godot.
- Influencers:
    - [Brackeys](https://www.youtube/@Brackeys)
    - [Passivestar](https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social)

# Demo: Bouncing balls!

- Floor is a [CSGShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/csg_tools.html)

![ball scene](/demo/ball_scene.png)

- Root is a [RigidBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody3d.html)
    - Contains a [MeshInstance3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_meshinstance3d.html)
    - Contains a [CollisionShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape3d.html)

- Make it a scene
- Add a lot of balls!

---

## Customize the ball color

```gdscript
extends RigidBody3D

@export var color: Color = Color(1, 0, 0)

func _ready() -> void:
    var material = StandardMaterial3D.new()
    material.albedo_color = color
    $Mesh.material_override = material

```

---

## Edit color in the editor

- add `@tool` to the script
- create a setter

```gdscript
@tool
extends RigidBody3D

@export var color: Color = Color(1, 0, 0):
	set(value):
		color = value
		var material = StandardMaterial3D.new()
		material.albedo_color = color
		$Mesh.material_override = material
```

---

## Add a button to create balls

```gdscript
@tool
extends Node3D

@export_tool_button("Add Ball", "Add") var add_ball_button = add_ball

func add_ball():
	var ball_scene = load("res://ball.tscn")
	var ball_instance = ball_scene.instantiate()
	ball_instance.color = Color.from_ok_hsl(randf(), 1, 0.5)
	ball_instance.position = Vector3(randf_range(-4, 4), randf_range(1, 5), randf_range(-4, 4))
	add_child(ball_instance, true)
	ball_instance.owner = get_tree().edited_scene_root
```
